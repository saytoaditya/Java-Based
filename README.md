# Switchboard simulation
A switch board has a set of buttons which are used to control the state of appliances and switch them
`on` or `off`.
Design a switch board simulation that is used to control electric appliances in a room. The supported
appliances are
1. Fan
2. AC
3. Bulb
This should be console application with the following behavior
 On startup asks user for
1. Number of fans
2. Number of ACs
3. Number of bulbs.
 Setups a menu with state of each appliance
1. Fan 1 is “Off”
2. Fan 2 is “Off”
3. AC 1 is “Off”
 Allows user to select the device by entering the device number.
 On selecting the device shows the menu
1. Switch Fan 1 On (or Off based on current state)
2. Back
 On selecting one of the option changes the state of the device and returns back to the main
menu.
 The main menu now reflects the new state of the device such as
1. Fan 1 is “On”
2. Fan 2 is “Off”
3. AC 1 is “Off
